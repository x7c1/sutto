# Trial Period

## Definition

**Trial Period** is a free period that grants full access to all features without requiring a [License](../license/).

Usage days are counted based on actual usage — only days when the user uses the application count toward the limit, with a maximum of one day counted per calendar day.

## Examples

- A user installs the application and begins a Trial Period
- A user who uses the application on Monday and Tuesday has two fewer days remaining, regardless of how many calendar days pass between uses
- A user who opens the application twice on the same day still has only one usage day counted

## Collocations

- record (a usage day in the Trial Period) — count a day of usage
- reset (a Trial Period) — restore the Trial Period to its initial state

## Related Concepts

- See [License](../license/) for the subscription-based authorization that follows the Trial Period
- See [License Status](../license/license-status/) for the "trial" status associated with an active Trial Period
