# License Status

## Definition

**License Status** is the current state of the licensing system. It determines whether the user has access to all features.

There are four statuses:

- **trial** — The user is within the [Trial Period](../../trial-period/) and has not activated a [License](../)
- **valid** — The user has an active [License](../) with a valid subscription
- **expired** — The user's [License](../) subscription period has ended
- **invalid** — The [License](../) could not be validated (e.g., cancelled subscription)

## Examples

- A new user who has never activated a License Key has the status "trial"
- A user who activated a License Key with an active subscription has the status "valid"
- A user whose subscription ended last week has the status "expired"

## Collocations

- check (a License Status) — determine the current status
- display (a License Status) — show the status to the user

- See [Trial Period](../../trial-period/) for the free usage period associated with the "trial" status
