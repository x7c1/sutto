# Space

## Definition

**Space** is a concept that contains multiple displays (monitors).

A space represents a virtual desktop or workspace that spans across multiple physical monitors. Each space maintains its own layout configuration for each monitor.

## Examples

- **Space 1**: Monitor 0 uses "vertical 3-split", Monitor 1 uses "horizontal 2-split"
- **Space 2**: Monitor 0 uses "horizontal 2-split", Monitor 1 uses "full screen"

Each space can have different layout configurations for the same set of physical monitors.
