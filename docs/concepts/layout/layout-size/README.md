# Layout Size

## Definition

**Layout Size** defines how large a window should be on the screen.

Unlike simple numeric dimensions, Layout Size uses string expressions that support various formats:
- Fractions: "1/2", "1/3", "2/3"
- Percentages: "50%", "100%"
- Pixels: "300px", "500px"
- Calculations: "100% - 20px", "1/2 + 10px"

## Examples

- `width: "100%", height: "100%"` - Full screen
- `width: "50%", height: "100%"` - Half width, full height
- `width: "1/3", height: "1/2"` - One-third width, half height
