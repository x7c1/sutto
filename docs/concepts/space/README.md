# Space

## Definition

**Space** is a container that holds multiple [Displays](../display/).

A Space represents a virtual desktop or workspace that spans across multiple physical monitors. Each Space maintains its own [Layout Group](../layout-group/) configuration for each [Display](../display/).

## Examples

- **Space 1**: Monitor 0 uses "vertical 3-split", Monitor 1 uses "horizontal 2-split"
- **Space 2**: Monitor 0 uses "horizontal 2-split", Monitor 1 uses "full screen"

Each Space can have different [Layout Group](../layout-group/) configurations for the same set of physical monitors.

## Collocations

- switch (to a Space)
- create (a Space)
- delete (a Space)
