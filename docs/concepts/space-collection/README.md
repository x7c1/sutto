# Space Collection

## Definition

**Space Collection** is a container that holds multiple [Spaces](../space/) organized into rows.

A Space Collection represents a complete workspace configuration that users can switch between. For example, a user might have separate collections for "Work", "Home", or "Single Monitor" setups, each with different Space arrangements optimized for that context.

Only one Space Collection can be active at a time.

## Types

There are two types of Space Collections:

- **Preset**: Pre-configured collections generated based on the current monitor setup
- **Custom**: User-created collections with custom Space arrangements

## Examples

- **Work Collection**: Multiple Spaces configured for a dual-monitor setup at the office
- **Home Collection**: Spaces configured for a single ultrawide monitor
- **Presentation Collection**: Simplified Spaces for screen sharing scenarios

## Collocations

- load (a Space Collection)
- save (a Space Collection)
- add (a Space Collection)
