Status: Draft

## Overview

## Content

### License Activation

- What happens after successful activation (status shows "Valid until" date)

### Troubleshooting
- **"License key not found"**: Invalid key entered
- **"Subscription has expired"**: Renewal needed
- **"Subscription was cancelled"**: Contact support
- **"No internet connection"**: Check network, retry
- **"License server unavailable"**: Temporary issue, retry later
