# @girs Package Beta Versions

## Version Schema

Structure of @girs package version numbers:

```
14.0.0-4.0.0-beta.38
  │     │      │
  │     │      └─ ts-for-gir build number
  │     └──────── ts-for-gir version
  └────────────── GNOME library version
```

## Why Beta?

@girs packages are auto-generated by [ts-for-gir](https://github.com/gjsify/ts-for-gir):

1. **Generates TypeScript type definitions from GObject Introspection**
2. **ts-for-gir 4.0.0 is currently in beta stage**
3. **The type generator itself is beta**, so generated type definitions are also beta

## Production Readiness

**Conclusion: Production Ready**

✅ **GNOME libraries themselves are stable** (e.g., Meta 14 = GNOME 46)
✅ **Type generator is in beta** (under development)
✅ **Published with `latest` tag** = de facto stable release
✅ **Works in production** (production ready)

## Examples

- GNOME Shell 46.0.2 = **stable release**
- @girs/gnome-shell@46.0.2 = **stable release** (matches official GNOME)
- @girs/meta-14@14.0.0-4.0.0-beta.38 = **stable release** (beta refers to ts-for-gir version)

## Key Point

**Don't be misled by "beta" in the name**

Until the ts-for-gir project releases 4.0.0 stable, all @girs packages will have beta in their version numbers. In practice, these are production-quality packages.

## npm dist-tags

```json
{
  "dist-tags": {
    "latest": "14.0.0-4.0.0-beta.38"
  }
}
```

npm treats versions containing "beta" as `latest`. This indicates they are officially recommended versions.
