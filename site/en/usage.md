# Usage

## Drag-to-Snap

1. Drag any window to a screen edge
2. The layout panel appears at your cursor
3. Click a layout button to snap the window into position

## Main Panel Interaction

Once the layout panel appears, you can interact with it using either the mouse or the keyboard:

- **Mouse**: Click a layout button to apply it
- **Arrow keys**: Navigate between layout options
- **Enter**: Apply the selected layout
- **Escape**: Dismiss the panel without applying a layout

## Keyboard Shortcut (Optional)

You can set a keyboard shortcut to open the layout panel without dragging:

1. Open preferences:
   - Click the settings icon in the main panel footer, **OR**
   - Open GNOME Extensions app → click the settings icon on Sutto
2. Click "Disabled" to set a keyboard shortcut
3. Press your desired key combination (e.g., `Super+Space`)
4. Press the shortcut to open the main panel for the focused window

Keyboard shortcut is disabled by default to avoid conflicts with existing keybindings.

## Layout Customization

Layouts are defined in JSON format, giving you full control over window positions and sizes. You can create your own layout collections tailored to your monitor setup and workflow.

See the [example collections](https://github.com/x7c1/sutto/tree/main/docs/examples) for reference configurations including single-monitor, dual-monitor, ultrawide, and streaming setups.
