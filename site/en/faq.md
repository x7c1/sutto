# FAQ

## What counts as a trial day?

A trial day is an actual usage day, not a calendar day. A day is counted when the extension is first used on that day. If you don't use Sutto on a given day, it doesn't count toward your 30-day trial.

## Can I use Sutto on multiple devices?

Yes. A licensed subscription supports up to **3 device activations**. If you activate on a 4th device, the oldest activation is automatically deactivated.

## What happens when my trial expires?

The extension is disabled until you purchase a license. Your preferences and configuration are preserved — once you activate a license, everything works as before.

## Do I need internet to use Sutto?

Internet is needed for license activation and validation, but the extension works offline for up to **7 days** after the last successful validation.

## Which GNOME Shell versions are supported?

Sutto currently supports **GNOME Shell 46**.

## How do I report a bug?

Please open an issue on the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/x7c1/sutto/issues) page. Include your GNOME Shell version and steps to reproduce the problem.

## How do I set a keyboard shortcut?

See the [Usage guide](/usage#keyboard-shortcut-optional) for step-by-step instructions on configuring a keyboard shortcut.
