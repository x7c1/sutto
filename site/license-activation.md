# License Activation

## Activating Your License

1. Open Sutto preferences:
   - Click the settings icon in the main panel footer, **OR**
   - Right-click the extension in GNOME Extensions app → Preferences
2. Go to the **License** section
3. Enter your license key and click Activate
4. After successful activation, the status shows your "Valid until" date

## Troubleshooting

### "License key not found"

The entered key is invalid. Double-check that you copied the full license key from your purchase confirmation email.

### "Subscription has expired"

Your subscription period has ended. Renew your subscription to continue using Sutto.

### "Subscription was cancelled"

Your subscription has been cancelled. If this is unexpected, please contact support via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/x7c1/sutto/issues).

### "No internet connection"

License validation requires an internet connection. Check your network connection and try again.

### "License server unavailable"

The license server is temporarily unavailable. This is usually a temporary issue — please try again in a few minutes.

### Device Limit

Each license supports up to **3 device activations**. If you activate on a 4th device, the oldest activation is automatically deactivated.

To check which devices are active, review the License section in preferences.

### Offline Usage

After a successful license validation, Sutto works offline for up to **7 days**. After 7 days without a successful validation, the extension will require an internet connection to verify your license.
