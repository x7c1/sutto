2. Go to the **License** section
3. Enter your license key and click Activate

## Troubleshooting

### "License key not found"

The entered key is invalid. Double-check that you copied the full license key from your purchase confirmation email.

### "Subscription has expired"

Your subscription period has ended. Renew your subscription to continue using Sutto.

### "Subscription was cancelled"

Your subscription has been cancelled and is no longer active. To continue using Sutto, [purchase a new license](/pricing).

### "No internet connection"

License validation requires an internet connection. Check your network connection and try again.

### "License server unavailable"

The license server could not be reached. Try again later. If the problem persists, the server may no longer be operational. Sutto continues to work normally regardless of server availability.

### Device Limit

Each license supports up to **3 device activations**. If you activate on a 4th device, the oldest activation is automatically deactivated.

### Offline Usage

Sutto works offline for up to **7 days** after the last successful license validation. After that, an internet connection is needed to re-validate your license.
