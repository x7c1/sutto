# Usage

## Drag-to-Snap

1. Drag any window to a screen edge
2. The layout panel appears at your cursor
3. Click a layout button to snap the window into position

## Main Panel Interaction

Once the layout panel appears, you can interact with it using either the mouse or the keyboard:

- **Mouse**: Click a layout button to apply it
- **Arrow keys**: Navigate between layout options
- **Enter**: Apply the selected layout
- **Escape**: Dismiss the panel without applying a layout

## Keyboard Shortcut (Optional)

You can set a keyboard shortcut to open the layout panel without dragging:

1. Open preferences:
   - Click the settings icon in the main panel footer, **OR**
   - Right-click the extension in GNOME Extensions app → Preferences
2. Click "Disabled" to set a keyboard shortcut
3. Press your desired key combination (e.g., `Super+Space`)
4. Press the shortcut to open the main panel for the focused window

Keyboard shortcut is disabled by default to avoid conflicts with existing keybindings.

## Layout Customization

You can customize available layouts in the Spaces page of preferences. This lets you configure which layout options appear in the panel for each workspace.
