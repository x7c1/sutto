# Claude AI Guidelines

## Documentation

**DRY Principle**: Write each piece of information in ONE place only.

- **README.md**: Overview and command reference only
- **docs/guides/**: Detailed explanations

Never duplicate content across files.

## Code Quality

After making code changes, always run:

```bash
npm run check
```

Fix any issues before considering the task complete.
